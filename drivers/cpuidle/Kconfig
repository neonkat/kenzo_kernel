	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using an ACPI-enabled platform, you should say Y here.

        help
         Allows the cpuidle framework to use different drivers for each CPU.
         This is useful if you have a system with different CPU latencies and
         states. If unsure say N.
